# EmotionCorrelation
614 Project: 
We can use this shared location of google colab to build our project. 

What we know so far - We are most probably interested in getting our own data from Twitter. Which means, we have to create a developer account for twitter and access the keys to start getting the data. We most probably have to use more than 1 account to get as much data as possible without having to pay a lot. 

Once we start gathering data, we can upload it in the required format in this shared drive so that our notebooks will be able to use them. 

Our project has several parts - 1. Data collection / Pre processing 2. Sentiment Analysis on individual tweets 3. Creating a metadata for emotion scores 4. Association rule learning algorithm,
